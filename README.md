# MIDS_w266_final_project_essay_scoring
Final Project for MIDS W266 Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Our research project seeks to experiment using pre-trained BERT embeddings coupled with a Two-Stage Learning Framework (TSLF) combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Attention for Semantic Score and Coherence Score at the first stage and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for the final score at the second stage (Figure 1).

Comparing to a baseline neural bag-of-words model, our final model has a 14.9% improvement, with a QWK score of 0.8346.

Data for this project was obtained from the ASAP competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes.
